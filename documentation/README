CRRCSim README

1. What is CRRCSim?
-------------------

CRRCSim is the "Charles River Radio Controllers Simulation",
a multi-platform simulation for R/C model airplanes. It was
originally written by Jan Kansky and Mark Drela, both members
of the CRRC (http://www.charlesriverrc.org). The simulation
focusses on the realistic simulation of gliders, but also
provides some powered airplanes.

Please take a look at the CRRCSim homepage for more information:

2. Installing CRRCSim
---------------------

Please take a look at the documents in the "Documentation"
subdirectory which describe the installation on all
supported platforms.


3. Reporting bugs
-----------------

First of all, please note that CRRCSim is still considered to
be beta software. We try to solve any problems as soon as
they are reported, but there might still be a lot of bugs
hidden in the software.

If you find a bug in CRRCSim we'd really appreciate if you'd take
the time to file a bug report at the CRRCSim project homepage
(http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/crrcsim). You can access the
bug-tracking system through the link "Bugs" on the aforementioned
page. Before adding a new bug, please browse through the existing
entries to prevent duplicates. You can always add aditional
information to an existing bug.

Please include as much information as possible in your bug report:
Operating system, CRRCSim version string (menu Help-->About) and a
description of the bug is the bare minimum. In addition you could
add the debugging information which is printed to stdout and stderr.
On GNU/Linux and MacOS-X simply start CRRCSim from a console window
and redirect the output into a file or cut and paste it from the
console window. On Windows you'll find two text files in the
CRRCSim directory named 'stdout.txt' and 'stderr.txt' which contain
all information from the last CRRCSim run.


4. Feature requests
-------------------

If you are missing a feature in CRRCSim, please let us know.
This helps us to priorize our future improvements. You can
use the feature request system provided by Sourceforge.net
which is accessible from the project development page
(https://developer.berlios.de/projects/crrcsim/). Just click
on the link "Features" on top of the page.


5. Where to get help
--------------------

Although there's lot of information provided in the documentation
directory, you might still run into problems when compiling,
installing or running CRRCSim. The following ressources might help
you in this case.

The CRRCSim Wiki
  
  http://crrcsim.berlios.de/wiki/
  
  The CRRCSim Wiki is a collection of web pages dealing with
  different aspects of CRRCSim. Here you'll find some documentation,
  a list of frequently asked questions (FAQ) and lots of links
  to CRRCSim-related web sites.
  The Wiki also gives you a chance to contribute to CRRCSim if you
  aren't familiar with programming. You can add information to the
  existing pages or even create new pages. You can express your
  opinion on existing feature requests by voting for them or adding
  a comment on the RoadMap page.
  Instructions on how to work with the Wiki are given at the bottom
  of the Wiki's MainPage.


The CRRCSim Yahoo! group
  
  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crrcsim/
  
  This is the place where the CRRCSim users meet. The group is
  unmoderated, so all you need to join is a valid Yahoo! Groups
  account. For more info on Yahoo! Groups, see http://groups.yahoo.com.
  The group is also frequently visited by the CRRCSim developers.


The CRRCSim development home page
  
  https://developer.berlios.de/projects/crrcsim/
  
  If you want to participate in the development of CRRCSim or just
  want to get the bleeding-edge CVS version of CRRCSim, this is
  the place to go. You can also access the download section
  containing previous releases from this page. Sourceforge also
  provides the above-mentioned bug tracking system and a
  sophisticated feature request management system.
