How to create a new release
===========================

=== Source 

Update documentation/ReleaseNotes

From the base directory, run (use correct version number):

  hg tag 0.9.13
  ./packages/source/create_archive.sh 0.9.13
  
This one creates a .tar.bz2 (don't distribute that one) and a .tar.gz
which is the source release you should distribute.
