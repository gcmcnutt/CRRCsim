  <h1>How to adjust helicopter parameters, helicopter model version 1</h1>

  <h2>0 General information</h2>
  
    <p>
      Please read <a href="../file_format/heli01.html">this file</a> for a
      description of helicopter parameters.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Please pay attention to <a href="interface_settings.html">these notes</a>.

  <h2>1 Suggested steps</h2>

    It is assumed that values for mass and inertia already are correct.
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        Before you edit the file, create a backup so you can lookup its
        original parameters.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Set <tt>adjust</tt> to <tt>1</tt> in the opening line of the
        <tt>config</tt> of the model file you want to
        tweak:
        <pre>
  &lt;config version="1" adjust="1"&gt;
        </pre>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Start CRRCSim, set wind speed and thermals to zero (there may be
        presets you can load).<br>
        Load the model you want to adjust. Save settings.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Hint: easiest way to edit/try parameters is
        to just 'ESC' (to stop the sim), edit and save parameter file, hit 'c' to reload
        parameters, 'ESC' (to start the sim).
      </li>
      
      <li>
        If <tt>power.fixed_pitch</tt> is set (fixed pitch heli), adjust
        <tt>power.automagic.F</tt> to set maximum climb rate.<br>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        For a collective pitch heli, adjust <tt>aero.cp.ctrl</tt> 
        and <tt>power.automagic.F</tt> to set maximum climb rate.
      </li>
                  
      <li>
        If <tt>aero.cp.auto_off</tt> is not defined or set to <tt>1</tt>,
        you don't need to care about <tt>aero.cp.off</tt>. If you don't like
        climb rate at neutral stick as it is automatically adjusted, set 
        <tt>aero.cp.auto_off</tt> to <tt>0</tt> and adjust <tt>aero.cp.off</tt>.
      </li>
                  
      <li>
        Set <tt>adjust</tt> to <tt>2</tt>, which enables tail rotor
        simulation.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        If the model has a heading lock gyro, set
        <tt>aero.yaw.HeadingHold</tt> to something greater than zero (maybe
        start with 5).
      </li>
      
      <li>
        The automatically adjusted mixer 'throttle or pitch to tail rotor' doesn't take into account dynamics
        (changes). You may calm down the tail on changes by setting
        <tt>aero.yaw.moment_mul</tt> to a value smaller than one (which is
        the default value).
      </li>
      
      <li>
        If you are done with the previous steps, enable training mode (hit
        't' to enable/disable) to fix the heli at a certain altitude.
        Set <tt>adjust</tt> to <tt>3</tt>.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Unless you know the model and its behaviour very good (in this case
        there's no need to read this help),
        remove <tt>aero.pitch.damp</tt> and <tt>aero.pitch.dist</tt> if they
        exist. They
        are taken from <tt>aero.roll.damp</tt> and <tt>aero.roll.dist</tt>
        if they don't exist.
      </li>

      <li>
        Adjust <tt>aero.yaw.ctrl</tt>, <tt>aero.pitch.ctrl</tt>, and
        <tt>aero.roll.ctrl</tt> for full stick rotation rates in
        rad/second.<br>        
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Adjust roll damping: <tt>aero.roll.damp</tt>.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Adjust yaw damping: <tt>aero.yaw.damp</tt>.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Do you think pitch damping (<tt>aero.pitch.damp</tt>)
        should differ from 
        <tt>aero.roll.damp</tt>? If this is the case:
        define and adjust it.
      </li>

      <li>
        Does the heli rotate around the correct point? Adjust its center of
        gravity. I'm sorry, but this setting won't get reloaded by hitting
        'c'. You have to save all settings, exit CRRCSim and restart.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        If you are done with the previous steps, 
        set <tt>adjust</tt> to <tt>4</tt>.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Adjust disturbances: <tt>aero.roll.dist</tt> and <tt>aero.yaw.dist</tt>.
        You may want to tweak <tt>Disturbance.tau_filter</tt> and
        <tt>Disturbance.time</tt>, too.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        If you are done with the previous steps, disable training mode (hit
        't') and finally set <tt>adjust</tt> to <tt>0</tt>.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Fly around and adjust <tt>aero.yaw.vane</tt>,
        <tt>aero.pitch.vane</tt>, and <tt>aero.speed.damp</tt>.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Adjust increase of disturbances in ground effect:
        <tt>GroundEffect.dist.mul</tt>.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Finally, you may want to tweak <tt>aero.roll.ForwardToRoll</tt>.
      </li>
