Installing CRRCSim on Microsoft Windows 98/2000/XP
--------------------------------------------------

For this platform we provide a Nullsoft installer containing
nearly everything you need to setup CRRCSim.

1. Download the installer from the CRRCSim homepage.

2. Install it the usual way (double-click and follow
   the instructions provided by the installer).

3. If you want to use the PARALLEL port interface, you
   need an additional DLL called dlportio.dll. If you're
   not planning to use the PARALLEL interface, you may
   safely skip this step.

   Due to licensing issues we are not allowed to provide the
   required dlportio.dll with CRRCSim. This means that you
   have to install it from a separate package. Download it
   from
   
   http://www.driverlinx.com/DownLoad/DlPortIO.htm
   
   and install it as described on this page.

4. Now you should be able to start CRRCsim by double-clicking
   the CRRCSim desktop icon or the Start Menu entry.


Uninstalling
------------

The installer automatically creates an entry in the control panel's
software dialog. Just select this entry and click remove, or
select "Uninstall" from CRRCSim's Start Menu folder.

This will remove all files which were copied to your computer
during installation. However, it will leave you configuration
file (crrcsim.xml) and any file created while running CRRCSim
(stdout.txt, stderr.txt). This allows you to keep your configuration
when installing a new version.
