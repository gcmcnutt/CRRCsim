Information on DLPORTIO.DLL
---------------------------

If you want to use the PARALLEL port interface, you
need an additional DLL called dlportio.dll. If you're
not planning to use the PARALLEL interface, you don't need
this DLL.

Due to licensing issues we are not allowed to provide the
required DLPORTIO.DLL with CRRCSim. This means that you
have to install it from a separate package. Download it
from
   
http://www.driverlinx.com/DownLoad/DlPortIO.htm
   
and install it as described on this page.
