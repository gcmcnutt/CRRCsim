  </p>


  <h2>2 Units</h2>
    <p>
    Some sections have an attribute <tt>units</tt>, which tells which units are used for the values in that section.
    The tables below have a column named 'unit' if the unit is fixed,
    otherwise they have columns like 'units=0' and 'units=1'.
    </p>
    <p>
    For example, the section <tt>aero</tt> has attribute <tt>units</tt>. Its
    documentation below tells you that you can set this attribute to '0' or
    '1', which lets CRRCSim expect a value with the unit indicated by just
    that table column.
    </p>
    <p>
    There is a file called non_SI_units.txt in the CRRCSim distribution which explains some strange units.
    </p>
    <p>
    Some parameters (especially aerodynamic coefficients) are without
    dimension, so their unit is just '1' (not to be confused with 'units=0'
    or 'units=1'!).
    </p>
    <p>
    Some parameters (like filenames) of course can't be said to have a unit,
    so their table entry is '-'.

                consistent.  Common references would be the center line of the body, the
                mean camber line of the wing root airfoil or the bottom of a flat bottom
                airfoil.  If you are doing analysis in AVL, its probably easiest to make
                this zero in the coordinates you use for the AVL model definition.  In
                the AVL Stability Derivative output (ST command), this is labeled "Alpha".

                flying wing.<br>
                This is a measure of how well the wing is working.  As mentioned, .95 is
                a good value for a conventional, aft tail airplane.  Some flying wings
                are essentially using the outer wing as a surrogate for the horizontal
                tail, so the number is lower.   For a canard, it could also be low.  AVL
                does a good job of estimating this parameter.  In the Stability
                Derivative output dump, it is the parameter "e".  This parameter will
                vary with angle of attack and stability margin, particularly if the wing
                has twist.  For a glider, pick a case at relatively high CL, like near
                the best glide ratio angle of attack, or near minimum sink.  This
                parameter only has a weak effect on the handling, so get it sort of
                close and dont worry about it.  (it is a big effect on efficiency).
                Note that AVL tends to slightly over estimate this parameter, so you
                might want to multiply the AVL value by .95 or so.

      <h4>3.2.1 <tt>CG_arm</tt></h4>
        <p>
        Email from Mark Drela, 10.01.2006:
        </p>
        <p>
        The stall model computes the values (dCL_left,  dCL_cent,  dCL_right)
        which represent the changes in CL due to stall.<br>
        To get the stall effect on the Cm, these are multiplied
        by the length CG_arm, which is the distance between
        the CG and the effective point of application of dCL:<br>
           dCm_stall = (0.25*dCL_left + 0.5*dCL_cent + 0.25*dCL_right)*CG_arm;
        </p>
        <p>
        The typical value CG_arm = 0.25 means that the point of application
        of the averaged dCL is 0.25*chord ahead of the CG.
        </p>
        <p>
        This CG_arm can be deduced from airfoil data.
        If dCL and dCm are the changes due to stall,
        the implied CG_arm is<br>
        CG_arm = dCm/dCL<br>
        Typically, both dCm and dCL will be negative, so CG_arm is positive.
        </p>
        <p>
        You can also adjust CG_arm to get a realistic simulator
        pitch response due to stall.  The larger CG_arm is, the more
        pitch-down you will get during stall.
        </p>              

    <h3>3.3 Subsection <tt>m</tt></h3>
      
      <p>
      These parameters deal with pitching moment, or how the airplane rotates
      about the pitch axis (up or down elevator).  The actual value would be
      foot-pounds or Newton-meters.  What we have here are coeffients, that do
      not have dimensions, so we can apply them to airplanes of similar
      configuration, but different sizes, airspeeds and air densities.
      </p>
      <p>
      To take one of these coefficients and convert it to the actual moment we
      would use the equation:<br>
      M= 1/2 * rho * velocity^2 * wing area * wing chord * Cm
      </p>
      The first terms, "1/2 * rho * velocity^2" are what is called dynamic pressure, or
      the ram pressure of the air.  (hold your hand out a car window to feel
      this!).  "rho" is density of air. The moment is also proportional to the wing area (i.e. what the
      pressure works on) and the chord of the wing (which is the moment arm).
      The area and chord are called "reference parameters".  Usually they are
      the actual area and the actual mean chord of the wing, but they could
      actually be any area or length, as long as you are consistent.  In AVL,
      these values are actually inputs to the program.  What counts is that
      you be consistent.  They are listed in the ST dump as Sref (area) and
      Cref (chord). In this file, they are <tt>aero.ref.area</tt> and
      <tt>aero.ref.chord</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Note that the yaw and roll deriviatvies use the wing span as the
      reference length instead of the chord.  That is Bref in the AVL output
      and <tt>aero.ref.span</tt> in this file.
      </p>
      <p>
      There are several terms that add up to the total pitching moment.

                This is whatever the Cm is at the reference angle of attack.  It

                in the wing etc.  In the AVL ST output dump, it is called "Cmtot"

                This is the change in pitching moment due to changes in alpha
                (angle of attack).  For a stable plane, this is negative, meaning if the
                angle of attack increases, there is a nose down pitching moment.  It is
                the slope of the CM vs alpha curve, as measured near the reference angle
                of attack.<br>
                In the AVL ST output, this is in the "stability axis derivatives"
                section, y mom row, alpha column, labeled Cma.

            <td>pitch-moment / pitch-rate  (pitch damping)<br>
                q is the "non dimensional pitch rate" of the airplane.
                Basically, it is related to the loop diameter divided the wing chord.
                It is the pitch damping effect.  Think of the tail as a long paddle
                swinging through the air.  The faster you rotate it, the more moment it
                makes, and the moment tries to stop the rotation.  For normal planes it
                is mostly proportional to the tail area times the SQUARE of the moment
                arm.  The force varies as the tangental speed of the tail in the
                rotation, and that is the angular rate times the moment arm.   We take
                the force, and multiply it by the moment arm to get the
                pitching moment.<br>
                In the AVL ST output  this one is in the "pitch rate q'" column, in the
                y mom. Cm row, and labeled Cmq.  Its normally negative.  i.e. a rotation
                rate causes a moment to try to stop it.

                pitching moment do you get for a unit deflection of the elevator (delta
                e is "change in elevator").  The way elevator is defined (trailing edge
                down is positive deflection) we want this to be negative.  i.e. trailing
                edge up gives a nose up moment.  You need to have defined an elevator in
                AVL before it will tell you what this parameter is, but the label on it    
                in the ST output depends on the order you defined control surfaces, so
                its hard to give an example.  It will be in the last block of outputs in
                the ST file, the column should be labeled elevator, or whatever you
                called that control in the AVL setup.  The row will be "y mom Cm".  If
                elevator was the second control defined, it would be labeled "Cmd2"

    <h3>3.9 Subsection <tt>flaps</tt></h3>
      
      <p>
      Lift, drag and moment coefficients are altered

            <td>How much of the initial flap effectiveness (lift/drag/moment derivative)
            is retained at the maximum deflection angle (flap_input=0.5) ? <br>
            Flap effectiveness usually decreases for large deflections (> 10-20deg), e.g. 
            when flap are also used as landing aids (cfr. Wasabi model).
            This non-linear behaviour can be simulated setting <tt>flap.eff_ratio</tt> < 1. <br>
            Reasonable values of <tt>flap.eff_ratio</tt> range  from 0.5 down to 0.1 for 
            maximum deflection from 30 to 60deg. <br>
            The actual effectiveness is evaluated as:
            flap.lift(@flap_input) = flap.lift * (1. - (1. - <tt>flap.eff_ratio</tt>)) * flap_input
            and similarly for drag and moment. <br>
            </td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>
      Usually changing flap setting change pitching moment and thus alter
      the trimmed angle of attack (AoA), so that elevator position must be adjusted
      (trimmed) to either keep the angle of attack unchanged or to trim to the new desired
      AoA. If you set <tt>flap.moment</tt> = 0, then the trimmed AoA will stay 
      constant.
      </p>
      <p>
      Flap (camber changing flap) can also be used "mixed" with elevator, so that an elevator
      input also generate a flap deflection to optimize airfoil camber for the desired lift
      coefficient (e.g. flaps are lowered when elevator is pulled).
      To achieve this effect the elevator should be mixed into flap input: the right amount of 
      mixing is model dependent.
      </p>
      
    <h3>3.10 Subsection <tt>spoiler</tt></h3>
    
      <p>
      This is similar to <tt>flap</tt>, except that the drag effect is linear not quadratic and
      that there is no eff_ratio parameter (spoiler effect is linear).
      </p>
      
    <h3>3.11 Subsection <tt>retract</tt></h3>
    
      <p>
      This subsection describes how a retractable gear influences drag and lift
      (similar to a spoiler). For an example, see <tt>sport.xml</tt>.
      </p>

            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td></tr>
      </table>
      
      <p>
      Please note that <tt>retract.lift</tt> is usually a negative coefficient, because the
      gear will disturb the airflow when it is not fully retracted and the wheel wells
      are open.
      </p>

    <h3>3.12 Subsection <tt>prop</tt></h3>
    
      <p>
      This subsection describes model-dependant interaction effects between propeller
      and aerodynamics. For an example, see <tt>Angel_S30E.xml</tt>.
      </p>

            <td>1</td></tr>
      </table>
      
      <p>
      Please note that <tt>prop.torquefactor</tt> shall be a coefficient < 1 (default to 0.25), 
      because propeller's slipstream produces an aerodynamic rolling moment counteracting torque effect.
      Changing the sign of <tt>prop.torquefactor</tt> to negative change the net rolling effect from rolling left
      to rolling right, i.e. simulating a counterclockwise rotating propeller (seen from the cockpit).
      </p>
      
  <h2>4 Configuration: section <tt>config</tt></h2>

    <p>
    There can be more than one configuration for an airplane, so there may be several
    <tt>config</tt> sections. Because of this, each <tt>config</tt> needs a description.
    </p>
    
  <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">

  <h2>5 Graphics: section <tt>graphics</tt></h2>
  <h3>5.1 Specifying a 3D model file</h3>

    <p>
    This section binds one or more 3D models to an XML file. The 3D model is what you actually
    see on screen when loading this model XML file. 
    There can be more than one graphical representation for an airplane (e.g. for
    different configurations or different finishs), so there may be several
    <tt>graphics</tt> sections. Because of this, each <tt>graphics</tt> needs a description.
    </p>
    
    <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
    &lt;graphics version="1" model="zagi.ac" &gt;
      &lt;descr_long&gt;
        &lt;en&gt;Automatically converted from superzagi.air.&lt;/en&gt;
      &lt;/descr_long&gt;

        &lt;en&gt;default&lt;/en&gt;
      &lt;/descr_short&gt;
    </pre></div>
  
    <p>
    Currently you only need to specify the name of the graphics file.
    </p>

  <h3>5.2 A word on 3D model files</h3>
    <p>The PLIB library used in CRRCsim to display the airplane model graphics can
    handle a lot of different file types. However, files in AC3D format (.ac) or
    3DStudioMax format (.3ds) seem to work best. Any decent modelling tool should
    be able to export at least one of these formats. AC3D, Blender and Wings3D have
    been reported to work fine for creating CRRCsim models.</p>

  <h3>5.3 Object names in 3D files</h3>
    <p>3D modelling tools usually compose the whole <i>model</i> (the content of the
    3D model file) from <i>objects</i>. An object is a group of <i>surfaces</i> (or <i>faces</i>
    for short) defined by connected <i>vertices</i> (a vertex is a single point in
    3D space).</p>

    <p>On object level, a modelling tool usually allows the user to define arbitrary
    names for single objects. These names provide better orientation while modelling.
    In CRRCsim, object names are also used to manipulate objects in several ways, like
    animating model parts or controlling the rendering process. Therefore the following
    conventions have been defined:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The object name assigned to a model part in a 3D modelling tool may 
          contain blanks (space characters). However, CRRCsim only uses everything
          up to the first blank as the object's real name. If you assign the name
          &quot;Right wing&quot; to an object, CRRCsim will internally refer to this
          object as &quot;Right&quot;. Therefore it is recommended to substitute blanks
          by underscore characters (&quot;Right_wing&quot;) or use CamelCase notation
          (&quot;RightWing&quot;).</li>
      <li>The rest of an object's name (everything after the first blank character)
          is treated as additional information (&quot;attributes&quot;)for the 3D
          rendering process. An object with the name &quot;Rotor_disc -shadow&quot;
          is internally referred to as &quot;Rotor_disc&quot;, and the attribute
          &quot;-shadow&quot; tells the 3D engine not to render a shadow for this
          part of the model.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>5.4 Object attributes</h3>
    <p>
    The following rendering attributes (see the preceding section) are currently
    defined for 3D objects:
    </p>

    <table border="1">

    <p>
    This section contains a number of entries, each of them describing one hard 
    point on the airplane. The caster angle is specified with respect to the
    plane body's z-axis, a value of zero means that the wheel is oriented straight
    ahead (which should be the case for most gears).

    <h3>6.1 Subsection <tt>pos</tt></h3>
      <p>Position of hard point in body axes with regard to center of gravity. 
      Unit is feet (<tt>units="0"</tt>) or meters (<tt>units="1"</tt>).
      x positive forward, y positive right, z positive down.</p>

      
      <p>Remark: 3D modelling tools sometimes use other coordinate system
      orientations. In this case the coordinates of a hard point have to
      be converted into the CRRCsim coordinate system. Here's an example
      for AC3D and Blender:</p>
      
      <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th>Axis in XML file</th>
        <th>Axis in AC3D</th>
        <th>Axis in Blender</th>
      </tr>
      
      <tr><td align="center">+X</td><td align="center">+Z</td><td align="center">-Y</td></tr>
      <tr><td align="center">+Y</td><td align="center">-X</td><td align="center">-X</td></tr>
      <tr><td align="center">+Z</td><td align="center">-Y</td><td align="center">-Z</td></tr>
      </table>
      
      <p>This means that a point in AC3D at X = -3.28, Y = 0.55, Z = -0.37
      (this could be the right wingtip of a 2m sailplane) will result in the
      following position tag:</p>

      <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
        &lt;pos x=&quot;-0.37&quot; y=&quot;3.28&quot; z=&quot;-0.55&quot; /&gt;
      </pre></div>

      <p>Hardpoints may be located on animated control surfaces (e.g. on a
      retractable gear). In this case, specify an additional attribute
      &quot;animation&quot; that contains the name of the control surface
      animation that controls this part of the 3D model. Example (from
      sport.xml):</p>

      <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
        &lt;pos x=&quot;0.41677001&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; z=&quot;0.52499998&quot; animation=&quot;nose_gear&quot; /&gt;
      </pre></div>

      <p>In this case, the &lt;animations&gt; section of the file should of course
      contain an element &lt;object name=&quot;nose_gear&quot; /&gt; that defines
      the actual movement. See section 8 for more details on animations.</p>

    <h3>6.2 Subsection <tt>spring</tt></h3>
      <p>This subsection defines the springiness of the hardpoint, e.g. if
      a collision of this hardpoint with ground makes the plane bounce, is
      damped by the hardpoint's flexibility or leads to a crash.</p>
      
      <p>The flight dynamics model calculates the forces on each hardpoint
      resulting from interaction with the ground or solid objects. If this
      value exceeds the specified <tt>max_force</tt>, the plane will be
      considered as crashed. The <tt>max_force</tt> attribute is optional;
      if it is not specified, it will internally be set to a very high
      default value so that this hardpoint will only cause a crash on
      insanely high load.</p>

        </table>
      
    <h3>6.3 Subsection <tt>steering</tt></h3>
      <p>In this subsection a mapping of the hardpoint to an R/C channel can
      be defined. Possible values for the &quot;mapping&quot; parameter are &quot;NOTHING&quot;
      (which makes this subsection redundant), &quot;RUDDER&quot;, &quot;AILERON&quot;
      or &quot;ELEVATOR&quot;. By specifying a negative value for max_angle the
      coupling from the control input to the wheel will be reversed. A positive
      angle should be correct for a tail wheel while a steerable nose wheel usually
      needs a negative angle.</p>
      
      <table border="1">
        <tr><th>Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>units=0</th>

      </table>
      
      <p>Example: this maps a nose wheel to the rudder channel, giving
      20 degrees (= 0.349 radians) of wheel deflection at full rudder input.</p>

  <h2>7 Center of gravity: section <tt>CG</tt></h2>
      <p>
        Position of center of gravity in body axes with regard to coordinates used by 
        <tt>wheels</tt> and the 3D graphics file.<br>
        Unit is feet (<tt>units="0"</tt>) or meters (<tt>units="1"</tt>).
        x positive forward, y positive right, z positive down. Example:

      </p>
      <p>
        This section and values do not have to exist, it is optional. 
        However, it gives you the following advantage:
        There is no need to create the 3D model (and the points in the <tt>wheels</tt> section)
        around the center of gravity. You can use any reference 
        point and give the position of the CG using your coordinates in this section.
      </p>
      <p>
        This also makes it possible to change the location of the CG without changing the 3D model and 
        <tt>wheels</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can visually check the position of the CG using test mode, as the airplane rotates
        around the center of gravity (given that throttle=0).
      </p>

  <h2>8 Animated parts: section <tt>animations</tt></h2>
      <p>This section contains information needed to animate parts of
      the model, e.g. to move the control surfaces according to stick
      input. It is optional to define animations for a model; however
      it is strongly recommended to make use of this feature because
      it adds much to the appearance of a model.</p>
      
      <p>To animate a part of a 3D model it is required that this part
      is modelled as an independent object in the 3D model file, and
      that the object has a unique name. A proper 3D modelling tool
      should allow one to group surfaces to objects and give them names,
      so this shouldn't be a problem.</p>
      
      <p>The <tt>&lt;animations&gt;</tt> section contains one 
      <tt>&lt;animation&gt;</tt> subsection per animated object. The
      <tt>&lt;animation&gt;</tt> tag must contain a <tt>type</tt>
      attribute to define the kind of animation that should be created.
      Currently only the type <tt>ControlSurface</tt> is implemented.</p>

      <table border="1">
        <tr><th>Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>unit</th></tr>
        
        <tr><td>type</td>
            <td>kind of animation</td>
            <td>-</td></tr>
      </table>

    <h3>8.1 Animation type <tt>ControlSurface</tt></h3>
      <p>This kind of animation is used to rotate an object of the 3D model
      around an arbitrary axis according to stick input. It can be used to
      animate control surfaces like elevator or ailerons, or to animate
      gears that retract with a rotational movement.</p>
      
      <h4>8.1.1 Subsection <tt>object</tt></h4>
        <p>This subsection defines the object to which the animation
        is applied and the maximum amount of movement.</p>
        
        <table border="1">
          <tr><th>Name</th>
              <th>Description</th>

              <td>control surface deflection at full control input</td>
              <td>rad</td></tr>
        </table>
      
      <h4>8.1.2 Subsection <tt>control</tt></h4>
        <p>This subsection defines how the surface interacts with the
        input from the controller. <tt>mapping</tt> can be set to one
        of <tt>RUDDER</tt>, <tt>ELEVATOR</tt>, <tt>AILERON</tt>,
        <tt>THROTTLE</tt>, <tt>FLAP</tt>, <tt>SPOILER</tt>, <tt>RETRACT</tt>
        or <tt>PITCH</tt>. There can be more than one <tt>control</tt>
        section for a surface, e.g. there will be a mapping to
        <tt>ELEVATOR</tt> and <tt>AILERON</tt> if the model has elevon
        controls (aka &quot;delta-mix&quot;). The <tt>gain</tt> setting
        determines the relationship of the control input to the
        surface deflection. A <tt>gain</tt> value of <tt>1.0</tt> means
        that the surface will travel the full <tt>max_angle</tt> from
        the <tt>object</tt> section above if the associated control
        is moved to its extents. Negative <tt>gain</tt> values will
        reverse the surface movement.</p>
      
        <table border="1">

        </table>
      
      <h4>8.1.3 Subsection <tt>hinge</tt></h4>
        <p>To define the rotation axis of the control surface it is
        mandatory to define exactly two <tt>&lt;hinge&gt;</tt> subsections.
        The rotation will occur around an imaginary axis from the
        first to the second hinge, and the direction of the rotation can
        be determined by applying the right-hand rule to this axis.
        The X/Y/Z values are kind of unit-less (&quot;OpenGL&quot;-units).
        They can be determined by selecting a vertex close to the hinge
        point in the 3D modelling tool and then transforming the
        displayed vertex coordinates into the coordinate system
        described below (same as with the <tt>&lt;wheel&gt;</tt>
        positions described above).</p>
