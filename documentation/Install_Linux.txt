                         How to install CRRCSim
                         
              ---------------------------------------------


General hints
=============

If you already have an executable file, continue. If you (only) have got the
sources of CRRCSim, please follow the instructions in compile.txt first.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GNU/Linux
=========

You should have an executable file (crrcsim) and the subdirectories
   documentation
   models
   scenery
   sounds 
   textures
with each one of them containing one or more files. There can be a file
crrcsim.xml, too.

They are several possibilities to install and run CRRCSim on linux, as it
tries to find the files it needs in some locations.

For a quick test you may change into the directory which contains the files
and directories mentioned above and call './crrcsim' there. But this is not
how you should really install it.

When CRRCSim needs a file, it will check directories in the
following order:

  1. The current directory ('./')
  2. ~/.crrcsim/
  3. /usr/local/share/games/crrcsim/
  4. /usr/share/games/crrcsim/
  
If you have root privileges on your system and want to install CRRCSim for
more than one user, you should copy the above subdirectories to
/usr/local/share/games/crrcsim/.
Calling 'make install_local' will do this for you, but you have to call it
as root. It will also copy the executable file 'crrcsim' to /usr/local/games/.
You have to make sure that /usr/local/games/ is in your path to be able to 
call 'crrcsim' from anywhere. Otherwise you need to call
'/usr/local/games/crrcsim'.

If you don't have root privileges, you can use 'make install_user', which
will copy directories to ~/.crrcsim/. It will not copy the executable
anywhere. You have to decide where you want it to be and copy it.

Configuration file 'crrcsim.xml':
CRRCSim can be run without this file. On startup, it tries to load this file
from the current directory. If that fails, ~/.crrcsim/crrcsim.xml is tried.

Kernel modules for certain transmitter interfaces:
The transmitter interfaces RCTran und RCTran2 use the same simple connection
of the PPM signal to the parallel port.
See interface_rctran2/kernel_module/README.txt
