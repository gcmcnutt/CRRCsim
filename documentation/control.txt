How to control the plane and crrcsim
------------------------------------

Besides mouse/joystick/transmitter input, the following keys can be used:

escape              show/hide graphical user interface
q                   quit
r                   restart after crash
p                   pause/resume simulation
c                   reload model configuration (see note below)
d                   toggle control input debugging mode
m                   toggle model's close-view window visualisation mode (0..2)
t                   toggle training mode which displays the location of the thermals
v                   toggle verbosity level (0..3) to display control inputs/FOV/FPS info
h                   toggle HUD compass visualisation mode
w                   toggle 3D wind vector visualisation mode (0..2)
g                   toggle landing gear (if function is not mapped to a controller)
b                   toggle spoiler/airbrake (if function is not mapped to a controller)
space               toggle slow motion
< and >             adjust slow motion time dilatation factor
page up             increase throttle (if you aren't using JOYSTICK or better)
page down           decrease throttle (if you aren't using JOYSTICK or better)
+                   zoom in (assuming zoom.control is KEYBOARD)
-                   zoom out (assuming zoom.control is KEYBOARD)
right/right arrow   rudder
up/down arrow       elevator


Note on reloading model configuration:
This feature allows you to reread the models parameters while the simulation
is running. Currently this does not affect its graphical representation, but
only its behaviour, so it is useful for adjusting model parameters without 
having to restart CRRCSim.
