  <h1>Controllers in CRRCSim</h1>

  <h2>0 General information</h2>
    <p>
    CRRCSim comes with a number of controllers which can be used to alter a
    model's behaviour. They can be controllers (in the meaning of closed
    loop control) or simply save flight data to files or modify input
    variables (the user's stick input) or something else. Controllers can
    receive keyboard input and write to the logging console window as well.
    </p>
    <p>
    They are activated and adjusted by tweaking either the xml
    file which describes the model (currently only for multicopter models)
    or CRRCSims global configuration file. There is no GUI.
    </p>
    
  <h2>1 For users and model creators</h2>

    <p>
    As far as controllers are concerned, you become a "model creator" once 
    you edit one, but in contrast to general "model creating" this is easy
    and might therefore be done by a user, too. For example, if you don't
    like the quadrocopter qc01 to limit throttle in flips automatically,
    simply remove the corresponding line from <tt>qc01.xml</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Some controllers can be used together with other controllers, some can
    not. 
    </p>

    <h3>1.1 Controller: <tt>ScaleThrottle</tt></h3>
      <p>
      This is not a real controller. The user's throttle input is in the range 0 .. 1. This controller alters
      throttle in the following way:
      </p>
      <p>    
      If throttle_in < <tt>off</tt>, throttle_out = 0.<br>
      Otherwise, throttle_out = <tt>min</tt> + (throttle_in - <tt>off</tt>) * <tt>mul</tt>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is defined like that:<br>
        <tt>
        &lt;ScaleThrottle off="0.06" min="0.178" mul="0.54" /&gt;
        </tt>
      </p>
      <p>
      It can be combined with controllers not altering throttle and with 
      <tt>LimitFlipThrottle</tt>.
      </p>
    
    <h3>1.2 Controller: <tt>LimitFlipThrottle</tt></h3>
      <p>
      Again, this is no real controller. It only limits throttle, which is 
      interesting for multicopters while flying loopings or flips.
      </p>
      <p>    
      If attitude is less than 60&deg; from horizontal, throttle is not limited.
      At 90&deg; it is limited to <tt>max90</tt>, at 180&deg; (upside down) it is limited to
      <tt>max180</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is defined like that:<br>
        <tt>
        &lt;LimitFlipThrottle max90="0.618" max180="0.3" /&gt;
        </tt>
      </p>
      <p>
      It can be combined with controllers not altering throttle and with 
      <tt>ScaleThrottle</tt>.
      </p>
    
    <h3>1.3 Controller: <tt>Omega</tt></h3>
    
      <p>
      To be used with multicopters, results in a rate controlled setup, so
      the sticks command how fast the copter rotates around roll/nick/yaw
      axis.
      </p>
      <p>    
      This controller is explained in "How to adjust multicopter parameters,
      multicopter model version 1" (<tt>qc01.tex</tt>), which is available
      online as pdf.       
      </p>
      <p>
      This one can not be combined with <tt>MCopter01</tt>.
      </p>

    <h3>1.4 Controller: <tt>MCopter01</tt></h3>
    
      <p>
      To be used with multicopters, results in an attitude controlled setup
      for roll/nick and rate controlled for yaw axis.
<pre>
      &lt;MCopter01&gt;
        &lt;roll  scale="1.8"  kp="7"    kd="0.246" /&gt;
        &lt;pitch scale="1.8"  kp="7"    kd="0.246" /&gt;
        &lt;yaw   scale="-9.93" kp="0.352" ki="0.835" /&gt;
      &lt;/MCopter01&gt;
</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
      The yaw controller is just like the <tt>Omega</tt> type (see above). For
      roll and pitch, the setpoint is <tt>stick_input * scale</tt> (in
      radians). Remember, stick input is -0.5 ... 0.5. <tt>kp</tt> is
      multiplied with the difference in attitude and gives the setpoint for
      the underlying rate controller. The difference in rotation rate is multiplied
      with <tt>kd</tt>. The result is the controllers output. Therefore,
      <tt>kd</tt> here is equivalent to <tt>kp</tt> of the <tt>Omega</tt>
      controller.
      </p>
      <p>
      This one can not be combined with <tt>Omega</tt>.
      </p>
      
    <h3>1.5 Definition of global controllers</h3>
      Add a section like the following to your global CRRCSim configuration
      file <tt>crrcsim.xml</tt>:
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;
&lt;crrcsimConfig version="2"&gt;
  &lt;controllers&gt;
    &lt;ScaleThrottle off="0.06" min="0.178" mul="0.54" /&gt;
    &lt;LimitFlipThrottle max90="0.618" max180="0.3" /&gt;
  &lt;/controllers&gt;
  ...
</pre>
      The examples show the file's first two lines, too, to make clear that
      the controller-section has to be a child of <tt>crrcsimConfig</tt>.
    
  <h2>2 For developers</h2>
      
    <p>
    Every controller inherits its interface from <tt>Controller</tt>, which
    is defined in <tt>src/mod_cntrl/controller.h</tt> and <tt>.cpp</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>      
    They are instantiated via <tt>Controller::LoadList()</tt> in the same
    files. It is up to the FDM to execute the controllers, even the global
    ones. 
    </p>
    <p>    
    To see how everything is done, it may be best to take a look at the class
    <tt>CRRC_AirplaneSim_MCopter01</tt> in
    <tt>src/mod_fdm/fdm_mcopter01/</tt> and <tt>Cntrl_MCopter01</tt> as an
    example. If you are new to CRRCSim, you surely don't know 
    <tt>SimpleXMLTransfer</tt>, which is the class used to read/write XML.
    This controller shows its basic usage and makes use of keyboard input and log output, too.
    </p>
    <p>
    The current controller implementation is not perfect; for example
    a serial connection of controllers is not possible (while a parallel
    connection is). However I felt it to be powerful enough while being
    simple...
    </p>
      
    <h3>2.1 MNav</h3>
      
      <p>
      Before this controller framework was implemented, an interface to the "MNav" 
      autopilot was implemented into CRRCSim. It was build as an input
      method (similar to joystick, transmitter or whatever).
      </p>
      <p>
      Doing it like this has several drawbacks:
      <ul>
        <li>
          In contrast to the controller framework, the input methods are not
          called with fixed timesteps, but dependent on screen refresh rate.
        </li>
        <li>
          How to do user input if the autopilot is an input method?
        </li>
        <li>
          A controller needs data from the flight dynamics model. In terms
          of clean APIs, an input method should not know about any FDM at all.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
      This subsection is not here to blame MNav but to explain why it is
      different from other controllers and why better not doing it like this.
      When it was implemented I, JWW, have not been interested and/or clever
      enough to say 'hey, don't do it like that'.
      </p>
      
  <h2>3 Ideas</h2>
   
    The list of things which can be done with controllers is quite big,
    but here I want to list some more or less obvious ideas.
      
    <h3>3.1 Recorder</h3>
      
      This could be a useful global controller. By a keystroke it could
      start/stop logging the model's position/speed/acceleration to a file
      for playback.
      
    <h3>3.2 Altitude controller</h3>
      
    <h3>3.3 Thermalling controller</h3>
      <a href="http://hem.passagen.se/skj/engelska/NEWS2005.HTM">like
      this</a> or the one described in 
      <p>
        <em>Das Thermikbuch fuer Modellflieger</em> written by Markus Lisken and
        Ulf Gerber, Verlag fuer Technik und Handwerk, Baden-Baden.
      </p>
      
    <h3>3.4 Training helper</h3>
      <p>
        With a helicopter, a controller could take care of pitch, throttle
        and yaw while the pilot practises nick and roll. Note: the heli01-FDM 
        doesn't execute local controllers yet, only global ones.
