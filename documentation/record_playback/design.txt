== Connections

The idle loop (in SimStateHandler) calls update on FDM and GameHandler.

=== Recording

On reset, a new recording should be started. Who knows about reset? It's the
SimStateHandler. The GameHandler has to be able to insert XML data.

The GameHandler has to be able to insert markers (or maybe more) and stop
the recording.

While the recording is active, the user can select a filename (and maybe enter
some description?). The description is inserted at once, whereas the
filename is set via a "mv" after the file has been closed.


=== Playback

When a file is selected for playback (shadow mode or not), it has to be
started at reset. 

In case of shadow mode, the GameHandler has to be called
when special records are read so that it can evaluate these records and
stop/continue playback.

In case of a start with velocity=0 and shadow mode, playback should be
synced according to throttle.


== File format

Binary file, starts with ascii-XML which may contain anything (scenery, airplane,
wind and thermal settings, game mode). After this first XML record, every
record starts with a single byte:

0x00: time, position, and attitude data; fixed format

0x01: control inputs, only needed for animated flaps, gears, ...

0x02: Marker. The following int32 gives more detail. Should it be fixed or
      should the meaning be defined in the initial XML record? 
      Example usage:
      The record starts with launch in F3F mode. The shadow plane moves on
      until it passes the first pylon (race starts), which is marked by a
      marker like this. It will wait there until the real player has passed
      its first pylon -- in case the real player already did, the shadow
      plane will not wait.
  
0x03: variable length XML record for future use.
