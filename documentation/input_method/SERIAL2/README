This is a very special interface, as it isn't useful to anyone but me (at
this moment, at least). My TX is able to send out its state via a serial
line in some special protocol. So this input-method decodes this protocol to
feed the values to crrcsim.

At the moment it only works for linux, but can easily be ported. Only the routines 
for reading the serial port need to be rewritten for others OSs.

If anyone is interested in using this interface (simple, as the UART is used),
I will of course write down some additional info about it.
