  This is a rough estimate of a 3S-3300mAh lipo pack.
  Note that C is given in Ah, not As. Everything else is SI.
  The table of relative no-load-voltage roughly represents a lipo discharge curve.
  Fully-charged voltage is 4.2V per cell
  Cut-off voltage is set to 3.0V per cell
  Internal resistance is guesstimate = 10mOhm.
