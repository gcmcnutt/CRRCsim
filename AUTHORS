-------

(1) The project on sourceforge is not active anymore.
(2) Mark Drela's ideas where coded by someone else, so he doesn't appear in
    any source code history and we don't exactly know which parts of CRRCSim
    came out of his mind.   
(3) He worked on a project called LaRCSIM, from which files have been taken.
(4) As of january, 2009.
